# AhoCorasearch

This lib is an elixir wrapper of the Rust lib Daachorse. 

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `aho_corasearch` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:aho_corasearch, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be found on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/aho_corasearch/usage.html).

## Basic Usage

```elixir
patterns = [
  {"search", 0},
  {"keyword", 1},
  {"text", 2},
  {"üìö", 2},
  {"üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è", 0},
  {"üóùÔ∏è", 1}
]
{:ok, tree} = AhoCorasearch.build_tree(patterns)
text = "This is some text(üìö) you want to search(üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) for keywords(üóùÔ∏è)."
AhoCorasearch.search(tree, text)
```
Result looks like:
```elixir
[
  {13, 17, [2]},
  {18, 22, [3]},
  {36, 42, [0]},
  {43, 59, [4]},
  {65, 72, [1]},
  {74, 81, [5]}
]
```

Could be processed like:
```elixir
keys = %{0 => :search, 1 => :keyword, 2 => :text}
Enum.map(results, fn {start, stop, ids} ->
  %{
    range: start..stop,
    match: :binary.part(text, start, stop - start),
    key: Enum.map(ids, &keys[&1])
  }
end)
```
Which returns:
```elixir
[
  %{match: "text", range: 13..17, key: [:text]},
  %{match: "üìö", range: 18..22, key: [:text]},
  %{match: "search", range: 36..42, key: [:search]},
  %{match: "üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è", range: 43..59, key: [:search]},
  %{match: "keyword", range: 65..72, key: [:keyword]},
  %{match: "üóùÔ∏è", range: 74..81, key: [:keyword]}
]
```

Patterns take the form `[{string: String.t(), id: pos_integer()}, ...]`, where `string` is a string you want to search for, and `id` is any positive integer that you can later use for linking matches. 

More examples and a deeper explanation of settings/options can be found in the HexDocs(or the Usage.md file)

## Credits

The underlying Rust library is Daachorse.

- [Github](https://github.com/daac-tools/daachorse)

- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/daachorse)

- [Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/daachorse/1.0.0/daachorse/)

It cannot be overstated how much of the performance(all of it) and capabilities(all but a few minor things like case insensitivity) of this library are due to the underlying Rust lib, daachorse. So a huge thanks to everyone who worked on that, and for releasing it with a permissive OSS license. This library wouldn't be possible without their hard work. 

Daachorse is released under both Apache 2.0 and MIT license.
